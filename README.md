**Data and Information Quality Project**
The project explores the impact of traditional and emerging Data Quality (DQ) issues on Machine Learning (ML) analysis, with a specific focus on the **"Completeness" dimension**.
It investigates how **Missing Not At Random (MNAR)** and **Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)** data affect ML models' performance in a regression task using synthetic datasets.
The project includes data preprocessing strategies, imputation techniques, and robustness evaluation to assess and mitigate the effects of missing data on predictive accuracy.
